## Overview

A Redis adapter for the [node-orm2](https://github.com/dresende/node-orm2) ORM.

Redis + Node ~= Peanut Butter + Chocolate :blue_heart: 

## Usage

Incorporating this Redis adapter into your project is pretty straight forward, provided you're already using node-orm2 today.

If you're not already using node-orm2, please check their [Github page](https://github.com/dresende/node-orm2) for details of how to get started.

After that, you can start working with Redis by requiring this package and calling orm.addAdapter:

    redis = require 'node-orm2-redis'

    #more code here
    orm.addAdapter 'redis', redis
      orm.connect connectionString, (err, db)->

## How it works

Under the hood, this Redis adapter makes several assumptions about how your keyspace should be managed.
Each persisted model is stored as a `Hash`, and each property is converted to a numeric score and stored in a sorted set.

Doing both allows for models to quickly be reconstituted and easily queried, at the cost of slightly more storage space per record.

Since each property has to be converted to a numeric score, there are some known limitations...

## Known Limitations

* When querying with a `String` property, only equalities are supported.
* not-equals (`orm.ne`) is currently not supported.
* Each model has to have an id, it has to be called `id`, and it'll be assign as a GUID (unless already assigned).

## Overview

A Redis adapter for the [node-orm2](https://github.com/dresende/node-orm2) ORM.

This is currently a work in progress, and is not yet intended to be used.

## Usage

Don't.

## How it works

It doesn't.

## Known Limitations

* When querying with a `String` property, only equalities are supported.
* not-equals (`orm.ne`) is currently not supported.
* Each model has to have an id, it has to be called `id`, and it'll be assign as a GUID (unless already assigned).
